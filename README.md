# EXAMPLE

```console
$ ji
...
```

# ABOUT

ji automates regular DevOps maintenance, including updating and rebooting servers.

Instead of typing out complicated commands, users get a series of simple prompts. The user confirms each maintenance task one by one.

This simplifies the maintenance process. It's great for saving keystrokes, for example on mobile terminal apps.

# INSTALL

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/mcandre/ji.git "$HOME/revamp"
2. Add `"$HOME/ji/bin` to your shell's `PATH` environment variable.
